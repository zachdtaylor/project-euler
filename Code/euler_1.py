"""Calculate the sum of all natural numbers that are multiples of
3 or 5 and less than 1000.

Details
-------
This algorithm uses the familiar sum formula
sum_{k=1}^n{k} = \frac{n*(n+1)}{2} (see thm. 1), noting that a number is
a multiple of both 3 and 5 if and only if it is a multiple of 15 (see thm. 2).

Theorems: 1, 2.

Complexity
----------
This algorithm is O(1) in both temporal and spatial complexity.
