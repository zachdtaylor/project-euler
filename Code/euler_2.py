"""Calculate the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers less than n = 4 million.

Details
-------
This algorithm uses the fact that the even Fibonacci numbers follow the
recurrence relation E_n = 4E_{n-1} + E_{n-2} (see thm. 5) combined with
dynamic programming to reduce the spacial complexity.

Theorems: 3, 4, 5

Complexity
----------
Temporal: O(n)
Spacial: O(1)
